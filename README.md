This repo has code for an Android app which does Sparse Reconstruction from multiple images. The actual reconstruction code runs on a python Flask server with [OpenSfm code from Mapillary](https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM). The Android app only acts as an input and output device for the reconstruction. 

This was made as a project for the course 16-822: Geometry-based Methods in Computer Vision taught by Professor Martial Hebert at the Robotics Institue at Carnegie Mellon University. A video demo for the alpha product can be seen [here](https://vimeo.com/128077041).
